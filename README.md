# Bear Fight

This is a small piece of interactive fiction, which is less for the
entertainment of the reader, and more as a proof of concept for me, the
developer. The goal of this project is twofold. First and foremost, I want to
design a streamlined system that does all the things I did in Blackout, but
with clearer, easier-to-maintain code. Second, I want to illustrate the
feasibility of a narrative-only boss fight. This is inspired by the combat in
PbtA roleplaying games, and how different such combat is from traditional D&D.
